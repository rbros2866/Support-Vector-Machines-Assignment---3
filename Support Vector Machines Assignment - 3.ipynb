    "\n",
    "**Mean Squared Error (MSE):** MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It penalizes larger errors more significantly than smaller ones. In the context of predicting house prices, where the absolute difference between predicted and actual prices matters, MSE provides a direct measure of the average magnitude of errors. By minimizing MSE, you are essentially optimizing the model to reduce the overall squared error, which tends to lead to better predictions in terms of minimizing the overall discrepancy between predicted and actual prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**R-squared (R2) Score:** While R2 score is a valuable metric for assessing the goodness of fit of the model and explaining the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model, it might not directly prioritize accuracy in terms of predicting the actual prices of houses. R2 score can be influenced by various factors, including the scale of the target variable and the presence of outliers. It measures the proportion of variance explained by the model relative to the total variance in the data, but it does not directly measure the magnitude of errors in predicting individual prices.\n",

    "When dealing with a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, it's crucial to choose a regression metric that is robust to the presence of these outliers. One of the most appropriate regression metrics to use in this scenario is the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE).**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robustness to Outliers:** MAE calculates the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. Unlike the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which squares the errors and therefore amplifies the impact of outliers, MAE treats all errors equally regardless of their magnitude. This makes MAE more robust to outliers, as extreme values have less influence on the overall metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretability:** MAE provides a straightforward interpretation of the average magnitude of errors in the predictions. Stakeholders can easily understand the average absolute deviation of the model's predictions from the actual values, even in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stability:** MAE tends to be more stable than MSE when dealing with outliers. Since it does not square the errors, MAE is less affected by extreme values, leading to a more stable evaluation metric.\n",

    "**Ease of Implementation:** MAE is easy to implement and compute, making it a practical choice for evaluating model performance in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretability:** RMSE is more interpretable than MSE because it is in the same units as the target variable. Since RMSE is the square root of MSE, it returns the error metric to the original scale of the target variable, making it easier to understand the average magnitude of errors in the context of the problem domain. For instance, if you are predicting house prices, RMSE would be in the same unit (e.g., dollars) as the house prices themselves, which can be more intuitive for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias towards larger errors:** RMSE penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones due to the square root operation. This might be desirable if you want to give more weight to larger errors in your evaluation, as it reflects a preference for reducing large errors over smaller ones.\n",

    "While both MSE and RMSE provide similar information about the model's performance, the choice between them often comes down to personal preference and the specific requirements of the problem. If interpretability and being in the same units as the target variable are important considerations, then RMSE would be the preferred choice. However, if you prefer a metric that directly represents the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, then MSE would be equally suitable."
